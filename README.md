# Braille Generator


## About

Braille Generator is the product of a challenge I gave myself to build a ReactJS/TypeScript application in only 1 day.  

I utilized Next.js API Routes to build a dynamic API route to create a custom braille dictionary.  The application will fetch this api in order to translate english letters and punctuation into uncontracted braille.  




This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
